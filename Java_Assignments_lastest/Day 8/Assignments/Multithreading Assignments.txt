1. Write a program that creates 2 threads to perform following
	operations:
	The first thread prints all the English alphabets
	in Uppercase

	The second thread prints the values of the alphabets

	E.g.
	First Thread: A, B, C and so on
	Second Thread: 65, 66, 67 and so on
	Both the threads must print their values using a same
	time gap.

2. Create a class PaytmAccount with following attributes:
	mobileNo (String)
	name (String)
	balance (int)

	Implement 2 additional methods:
		void addMoney(int)
		void makePayment(int)

Write a program that creates 2 threads in such a way that both
the threads use the same object of PaytmAccount and one thread
adds the money whereas the another thread makes the payment.

Display messages with current balance using some time gap
while performing both the transactions.

Note***
(When one thread is using the object, access should be denied 
for the other thread.)
