Time Limit: 45 Minutes

Create a file work_duration.txt that maintains a data about work done by a specific worker 
for the 5 days of a week in the format <<hours>>:<<minutes>>
E.g.

5:25
6:30
5:45
7:15
9:20

Write a program that fetches a data from the file and shows total duration of work done by
that worker in terms of hours and minutes.

E.g.
As per the sample data, total hours = 32 and total minutes = 135 (2 hours and 15 minutes)

Hence the output should be:
Total duration: 34 hours and 15 minutes.

(Hint: Use String class appropriate method and an appropriate wrapper class)
