Create a class Score with following attributes:

Write a main program that creates at least 2 objects of Batter and prints their names along
with batting averages.

(Note: If the Batter remains NOTOUT through out the series, batting average must be displayed
	as "Infinity".  To handle this, write any algorithm of your choice.
		Scores are for 5 match series.)
