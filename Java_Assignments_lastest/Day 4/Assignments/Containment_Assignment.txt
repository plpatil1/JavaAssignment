Create a class Location with following attributes:
	name (String) e.g. Kothrud, Deccan, Camp, Koregaon Park
	ratePerSquareFeet (int)
Create a class Flat with following attributes:
	ownerName (String)
	type (String) : 1BHK, 2BHK, 3BHK
	locality (Location)
	carpetArea (int)
	floor (int) e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3
	havingLift (boolean)
	havingReservedParking (boolean)
	yearsOld (int)

Provide a method: 
	float getAgreementCost()

The method must calculate the cost considering following:
	1. Cost will be calculated based upon built up area
		Built Up Area = Carpet Area + its 25%
				1000 + 250 = 1250
	2. If the flat does not have a lift and it is on the
		floor greater than 3 then deduct 2% of the cost
	3. If the flat is old 
		more than 5 years: deduct 2% more
		more than 10 years: deduct 5% more
	4. If the flat does not have reserved parking,
		deduct 150000
