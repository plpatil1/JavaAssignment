Time Limit: 30 Minutes
Create a class Event with following attributes:
	int eventId;
	String eventName;
	float baseFare; 10000

Create a subclass OvernightEvent from Event with following attributes:
	int days;		4
	int ratePerDay;		5000
	int roomCount;		5
	int farePerRoom;	3000    expected o/p 75k

Create another subclass OnedayEvent from Event with following attributes:
	int hours; 4
	int ratePerHour; 2000
	int extraHours; (500) 2		expected o/p 19k
Override a method float getTotalFare() in all 3 classes


Write a main program that builds at least 1 object each of types: 
OvernightEvent and OnedayEvent and calculates the total fare.

(Note: farePerRoom is for 1 night and no. of nights is 1 less than the no 
of days of event. The rate per extraHour is of your choice.)
